                You acknowledge and agree that a legally binding contract (the “
                <span className="u-bold">Service Agreement</span>”) is formed when you agree on the
                terms of a Task with another User. The terms of the Service Agreement include the
                terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the
                BidOrBoo Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Tasker and
                their Client to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this
                Agreement, including this Section 3, and do not expand Company’s obligations or
                restrict Company’s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a
                party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not,
                under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between
                Company and the Tasker (or Assistants (as defined below)), nor will it create an
                employment relationship between the Client and the Tasker (or Assistants (as defined
                below)). Company’s role is restricted solely to acting as a limited payment
                collection agent for the Tasker to facilitate payment on behalf of the Tasker
                through the BidOrBoo Platform using the PSP in respect of Tasks they perform. In
                acting as the limited payment collection agent for particular Tasks on the BidOrBoo
                Platform, BidOrBoo disclaims any other agency or authority to act on behalf of the
                Tasker, and assumes no liability or responsibility for any acts or omissions of the
                Tasker, either within or outside of the BidOrBoo Platform.
              </p>
              <p className="subtitle">
                Where approved in advance by the Client, the Tasker is not obligated to personally
                perform the Task. Before any Task services are performed by any assistants, helpers,
                subcontractors or other personnel engaged by the Tasker (collectively “
                <span className="u-bold">Assistants</span>”), the Tasker shall require any such
                individuals to become fully registered, oriented and verified Taskers on the
                BidOrBoo Platform. A Tasker’s failure to comply with this provision by bringing an
                Assistant who is not a registered Tasker could lead to removal from the BidOrBoo
                Platform. The Tasker assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions
                of such Assistants, including without limitation the payment of all compensation,
                benefits and expenses of Assistants, if any, and for all required and applicable

                within 24 hours of the work being performed, even if the Task is not completed in
                its entirety or is designated as “ongoing”. Clients will be responsible for paying
                the invoice for each Task (the “<span className="u-bold">Invoice</span>”), which
                will include (i) the pricing terms of the Task agreed with and provided by a Tasker
                (“

                Users with customer support, providing the Happiness Pledge set forth in Section 13,

                To help prevent fraud and safeguard User information from the risk of unauthorized
                access, Company and/or the PSP may validate an account before activation. As part of
                the account validation, a temporary charge is placed on the account associated with
                the User and then refunded within 1-3 business days. Due to the difference in PSP
                and credit card issuer requirements, this temporary charge may vary between $0.01 to
                $5,000.00, depending on the estimated value of the Task and expenses.

                you cannot add value/balance to your Gift Card at this time). If a Gift Card
                holder’s purchase exceeds the amount of that Gift Card’s balance, the Gift Card
                holder must pay the difference by another means. Unused Gift Card balances are not

                The BidOrBoo Happiness Pledge is part of this Agreement and incorporated by
                reference. Taskers determine what categories they are qualified to task in, and
                scope the Task directly with their Client. BidOrBoo does not oversee, monitor or
                direct how a Tasker performs a Task, does not monitor Tasks or chat threads between
                Users, and does not otherwise oversee or assume responsibility for the actions of
                Users. Clients are advised to confirm with their Tasker that their Tasker is
                qualified to perform the Task prior to the Task taking place. BidOrBoo is not liable
                for the acts or omissions of Users, nor does BidOrBoo provide insurance against any
                losses sustained by Users. That said, BidOrBoo wants Users to be happy about their
                experience using the BidOrBoo Platform and the Happiness Pledge is in place to
                encourage continued use of the BidOrBoo Platform.
              </p>
              <p className="subtitle">
                Payments made under the Happiness Pledge are entirely discretionary, however, and
                subject to certain conditions, limitations and exclusions, as described in the
                Happiness Pledge. The Happiness Pledge does not supercede any of the terms set forth
                in the Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, including any of the limitations on
                liability set forth in Sections 12 and 17 of these Terms of Service. In the unlikely
                event of a conflict with the Happiness Pledge, these Terms of Service prevail over
                any contrary interpretation of the Happiness Pledge. The BidOrBoo Happiness Pledge
                is not intended to be any sort of insurance and BidOrBoo is not an insurer, as such
                terms are understood for regulatory purposes.
